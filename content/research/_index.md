Novelty Probing
Measurement of Xi Jinping’s policy preferences and political influence by comparing the autocrat’s speeches with official state reports 
<details>
  <summary><i>Abstract</i></summary>

The leader’s preferences shape policy outcomes, however, the lack of accurate tools to measure
the leader’s priorities, especially among autocrats, leads to overlooking these preferences as part
of elite decision-making processes. To solve that, this paper introduces Novelty Probing, a new
method for measuring the policy priorities of political elites across topics, and their influence on the
same topics. This framework quantifies the novelty and influence of a leader’s ideas by utilizing
semantic similarity between sentence embeddings to assess the deviation of their speeches from
official propaganda, constructing indices for a leader’s novelty, and influence across policy topics.
The Novelty and Influence indices are combined to create the Dominance Index, a metric for a
leader’s ability to implement their novelty into policymaking.
The paper exemplifies the method in the field of Chinese elite politics, by applying the Novelty
Probing framework to Xi Jinping, using a corpus of Xi’s speeches and 179823 China’s State-Councilissued
communications. Hence, this study measures Xi’s policy novelty, level of influence, and
dominance over China. To represent the usage of the measures, the paper provides five empirical
results to study patterns of Chinese elite politics. First, Novelty Probing is used for a mini case
study of the effect of Xi on Health policy, by highlighting key speeches, and policy documents
affected by these speeches. Second, the method is employed to reveal temporal patterns in Chinese
elite politics. Third, Novelty Probing constructs a quantitative case for comparison Between Xi
and Li Keqiang, the primer of China, and indices are used to study Xi’s consolidation of power
after the 19th Party Congress. Fourth, the author conducts audience analysis for Xi’s speeches.
Fifth, the framework aggregated evidence that indicates Xi has only minor dominance over foreign
policy making in China.
